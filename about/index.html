                            Emma is a web developer in Portland, OR. She loves
                            to make pixel art of all kinds, but especially super
                            adorable pixel cats. In addition to pixel art, Emma
                            loves CSS, array methods, and weekly builds (just
                            kidding).

                            Fora is a web developer in the Portland, OR area. 
                            Pixel art and chiptune have set the scene for Fora's 
                            adventures through life, from a Gameboy and Pokemon Gold, 
                            to Minecraft and Valheim. This project aligns pixel 
                            perfectly with Fora's passion for technology, art and logic.

                            As a software developer and lover of the arts, PIXL is a perfect blend of Ian's
                            interests. When he's not programming, you'll likely find him 
                            drawing, hunting down new music, playing games (both 8-bit and not), 
                            and exploring the wilds of Reno, NV and beyond...

                            Violet is a web developer who may or may not be made
                            of hundreds of pixels herself. She loves to make art
                            in all forms and wanted to work on this project to
                            use a creative approach to make making art more
                            accessible to those who balk at the thought of
                            picking up a paintbrush. She is currently located in
                            Portland, Oregon.
