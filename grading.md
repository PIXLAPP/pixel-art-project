## General Notes
* This is awesome -- I love when you can tell that a team had fun making something and you definitely can with this app
* app.js has a lot of repeated code which makes it a little tricky to understand -- extracting things into functions (and adding tests) would make it easier to understand
* Great job getting the save button working -- its not always easy to pull in third party libraries with vanilla JS but you all did awesome getting that working
* I have like a thousand new features I want on this because its so fun and cool -- you might be seeing a pull request from me :)
